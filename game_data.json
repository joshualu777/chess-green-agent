    "Move 44 model response for Black": "Your queen has just been exchanged, and you are left with a simple king\u2011and\u2011pawn endgame: you have an extra g\u2011pawn, and your king is already very active. The simplest winning plan is to march your king toward the queenside pawns, support your own pawn majority, and convert.\n\nThe move 44...Kg5 is strong:\n- Centralizes the king toward the center and kingside.\n- Keeps maximum flexibility: from g5 you can head toward the queenside (f5\u2013e5\u2013d5\u2013c4\u2013b4\u2013a4) while also stopping any advance of the white pawns.\n- No stalemate or drawing tricks exist; with an extra pawn and better king, this is a technically winning endgame.\n\nFinal Answer: 4423",
